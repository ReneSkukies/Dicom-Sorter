# Dicom-sorter
 Functions used to sort dicom files from Philips 3T MRI scanner after a scanner error/bug that puts everything in the same folder.

Use the dicom_sorter function from the matlab command window to sort dicoms.
Look at help 'dicom sorter' (in Matlab) for explanation on how to use.

You need to change the paths in line 24/25 to the directory where the dicom sorter folder is stored.
